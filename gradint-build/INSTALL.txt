Installing Gradint on Linux systems
-----------------------------------

Gradint does not need to be installed, it can
just run from the current directory.

If you do want to make a system-wide installation
(for example if you want to make a package for a
Linux distribution), I suggest doing the following
as root:

mkdir /usr/share/gradint
cp gradint.py /usr/share/gradint/
cd samples/utils
for F in *.py *.sh; do
  export DestFile=/usr/bin/gradint-$(echo $F|sed -e 's/\..*//')
  cp $F $DestFile
  chmod +x $DestFile
done
cd ../.. ; rm -rf samples/utils
tar -zcf /usr/share/gradint/new-user.tgz \
  advanced.txt settings.txt vocab.txt samples
cat > /usr/bin/gradint <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
if ! test -e "$HOME/gradint"; then
  echo "You will need some prompts and samples in your home directory."
  echo "Is it OK to unpack an example into $HOME/gradint ?"
  echo "Ctrl-C to quit or Enter to continue"
  read
  echo -n "Unpacking... "
  mkdir "$HOME/gradint"
  cd "$HOME/gradint"
  tar -zxf /usr/share/gradint/new-user.tgz
  echo "done."
  echo "Please check the contents of $HOME/gradint"
  echo "especially the README files."
  echo "Then you can run gradint again."
  exit
fi
cd "$HOME/gradint"
python /usr/share/gradint/gradint.py $@
EOF
chmod +x /usr/bin/gradint

For a distribution you might also have to write
man pages and tidy up the help text etc.

Depends: python + a sound player (e.g. alsa-utils)
Recommends: python-tk python-tksnack sox libsox-fmt-all madplay
