Gradint server tools
--------------------

gradint.cgi - CGI script to run Gradint completely online
(but just synthesized vocabulary for now).
Not integrated with email-lesson.sh below, because that needs a
large vocab (which probably needs non web-based admin)

email-lesson* - scripts that can help you to
automatically distribute daily lessons to students
using a web server with reminder emails

vocab2html.py - make an HTML index for a synth cache,
with the help of a vocab.txt (you can also use it with espeak.cgi)

samples.cgi - CGI script to browse a samples directory
(make sure you have permission to publish your recordings,
or that the site is not publically viewable)

espeak.cgi - script that lets a Web user play with espeak options
