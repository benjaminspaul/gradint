# Change the "en" and "zh" above to the abbreviations that
# you intend to use for your first language and the language
# you want to learn.
#
# For example, en = English, zh = Zhongwen.
# 
# Use any abbreviations you like, as long as you stick to
# them later, but you might want to use the same abbreviations
# as eSpeak if you'll be using synthesized words.  Keep the quotes (" ").
# 
# If you need to learn multiple languages at once, please
# see the file advanced.txt as well.
