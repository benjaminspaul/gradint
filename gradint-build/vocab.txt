# This is vocab.txt.  You can list here any words that you
# want synthesized by computer.  List one word per line.
# On each line, put the word or phrase in the second
# language, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the
# word or phrase in the first language.  For example,
# zai4 = again
# The words will be introduced into the course in the order
# that you list them.  (For more advanced options see below.)
# 
# If you have used the Gradint GUI to add words,
# they will appear at the END of this file (scroll down).
# 
# Any lines starting with a '#' (such as these instructions)
# will be ignored by the program.
#
# If you want to learn more than one language at a time, or
# if you want to use foreign-language prompts, etc, see the
# file 'advanced.txt' as well.
#
# IMPORTANT: Before speech synthesis will work, make sure
# that your computer has the necessary speech synthesizers
# for BOTH languages.  Gradint supports:
#
# 1. eSpeak, a very multilingual and multiplatform speech
# synthesizer available at http://espeak.sourceforge.net/
# and bundled with the Windows and Mac versions of Gradint.
#
#    - Just install it and gradint will find it.  Any of
#    eSpeak's languages can be used as long as you use the
#    same language abbreviations as eSpeak does, e.g. "en"
#    for English, "zh" for Zhongwen (Mandarin).
#
#    - By default eSpeak will be used for English too; if you want
#    to use Windows's or Mac OS X's voices for English, set the variable
#    'synth_priorities' in advanced.txt.
#
#    - You can improve eSpeak's English by installing
#    Festival's dictionary and using lexconvert to convert
#    it, see http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/gradint/lexconvert.html
#    (this has already been done in the bundled version).
#
#    - eSpeak is not very natural-sounding, but it is very
#    clear and accurate in English, Mandarin and some other
#    languages (although some languages may be poor e.g. the
#    ones marked "testing" or "feedback needed").
# 
# 2. Microsoft SAPI 5 (included with Windows XP, and can be
# added to earlier versions of Windows)
#
#  - can be used for English (language abbreviation 'en')
#
#  - can be used for Chinese if you have installed the
#  NeoSpeech "Lily" Mandarin voice (language abbreviation
#  must be 'zh', and use pinyin with tone numbers, 5 for
#  neutral tone, v or u: for u-umlaut and if possible put spaces
#  between meaningful words).
#  You can also include hanzi, if you make sure to save the file in UTF-8 format.
#     - Lily is very natural-sounding, but it has been known
#       to get quite a few phrases subtly wrong,
#       so make sure you can tell the difference.
#
#  - can be used for other voices if you set
#    sapiVoices in advanced.txt.
#
# The control panel's "Speech" option can choose the English
# voice (if you're using SAPI for English), and also the
# speed of all SAPI voices.
#
# 3. Other speech synthesizers:
#
# MANDARIN CHINESE - language abbreviation must be 'zh';
#   text should use Hanyu Pinyin with a tone number after
#   each syllable (use 5 for neutral) and v or u: for u-umlaut
#   (and if possible put spaces between meaningful words but
#   not between syllables within a word):
#
#    - eSpeak or NeoSpeech Lily, as described above.
#      (you can also include hanzi in UTF-8)
#      + others (MeiLing, Loquendo, etc) if you set sapiVoices
#
#    - Yali Cheng's Mandarin syllable recordings - see
#      instructions on website.  (You can also include
#      hanzi in UTF-8 if eSpeak is present.)  Recommended.
#
# ENGLISH (language abbreviation must be "en"):
#
#    - Mac OS X comes with English speech as standard
#      (you can choose the voice and speed in system preferences)
#
#    - Festival Lite on Windows (if all else fails) :
#      put flite.exe in the gradint folder
#
#    - Linux: install Festival, or flite if you want a US
#      accent, or (as already mentioned) eSpeak
#
#    - RISC OS: if for some reason you can't install eSpeak
#      as mentioned above, you can instead install an older
#      version of Jonathan Duddington's !Speak, or the even
#      older "Speech!" utility.  These can be used only for
#      playing in real-time, not for generating files.
# 
#
# 5. Other speech software can be used if you can tell
# gradint how to run it.  See 'advanced.txt' for details.
#
#
# OTHER POINTS TO NOTE:
#
# If you want to specify that a group of words should be
# introduced more slowly (for example because they are very
# similar and you don't want a whole lesson of just them),
# you can put the lines
# limit on
# and
# limit off
# before and after that group respectively.  You can do this
# for multiple groups and each will be treated independently.
#
# You can also specify "begin poetry" and "end poetry"
# around groups of lines that should be memorised in
# sequence (these do not need first-language equivalents but
# it is desirable to have them anyway, and beware that
# several consecutive lines that are very long might cause
# scheduling problems - split if necessary.)
# In the middle of a poem, you can write "poetry vocab line:" (without
# quotes) on a line by itself, and the line immediately under it will be
# interpreted normally without being linked into the poem.  This is useful
# for setting relevant vocabulary to be introduced part-way through learning
# the poem.
#
# If you have recordings in one language and you want the
# equivalents in another language to be synthesized, you can
# make ".txt" files to match the ".wav" files in the
# "samples" directory and its subdirectories.  For example
# if you have somefile_lang1.wav you can add
# somefile_lang2.txt to make a version in lang2 (where lang1
# and lang2 are any language abbreviations).  Each .txt file
# should contain only 1 phrase in 1 language and nothing else.
# (RISC OS users should replace '.' with '/'.)
# Verbal annotations, and -meaning files (see samples README
# file for details) can also be in .txt files.
