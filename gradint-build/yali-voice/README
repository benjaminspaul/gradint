yali-voice.exe is a zip file that must be
compatible with unzip on non-Windows platforms
as well as being self-extracting.

unzipsfx.exe is a Win32 build of unzipsfx
(cross-compiled with Mingw32) with
CHEAP_SFX_AUTORUN defined, and hacked process.c
so it doesn't confirm the Auto-run command.

Here's how to make a new yali-voice.exe
(unzip the old one to get setup.bat etc)

find setup.bat partials -type f | sort | zip -9 yali-voice.zip -@
echo '$AUTORUN$>setup.bat' | zip -z yali-voice.zip
cat unzipsfx.exe yali-voice.zip > yali-voice.exe
zip -A yali-voice.exe

Alternatively the existing one can be adjusted by using
zip -A yali-voice.exe partials/zh/yali/replacement-syllable.raw
