# This is vocab.txt.  You can list here any words that you
# want synthesized by computer.  List one word per line.
# On each line, put the word or phrase in the second
# language, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the
# word or phrase in the first language.  For example,
# zai4 = again
# The words will be introduced into the course in the order
# that you list them.  (For more advanced options see below.)
# 
# If you have used the Gradint GUI to add words,
# they will appear at the END of this file (scroll down).
# 
# Any lines starting with a '#' (such as these instructions)
# will be ignored by the program.
#
# If you want to learn more than one language at a time, or
# if you want to use foreign-language prompts, etc, see the
# file 'advanced.txt' as well.
#
# IMPORTANT: Before speech synthesis will work, make sure
# that your computer has the necessary speech synthesizers.
# See advanced.txt if you need to change the speech synth setup.
# 
# If using non-ASCII characters, please choose UTF-8 coding.
# 
# OTHER POINTS TO NOTE:
#
# If you want to specify that a group of words should be
# introduced more slowly (for example because they are very
# similar and you don't want a whole lesson of just them),
# you can put the lines
# limit on
# and
# limit off
# before and after that group respectively.  You can do this
# for multiple groups and each will be treated independently.
#
# You can also specify "begin poetry" and "end poetry"
# around groups of lines that should be memorised in
# sequence (these do not need first-language equivalents but
# it is desirable to have them anyway, and beware that
# several consecutive lines that are very long might cause
# scheduling problems - split if necessary.)
# In the middle of a poem, you can write "poetry vocab line:" (without
# quotes) on a line by itself, and the line immediately under it will be
# interpreted normally without being linked into the poem.  This is useful
# for setting relevant vocabulary to be introduced part-way through learning
# the poem.  (In recent versions of Gradint the colon can be omitted.)
#
# If you have recordings in one language and you want the
# equivalents in another language to be synthesized, you can
# make ".txt" files to match the ".wav" files in the
# "samples" directory and its subdirectories.  For example
# if you have somefile_lang1.wav you can add
# somefile_lang2.txt to make a version in lang2 (where lang1
# and lang2 are any language abbreviations).  Each .txt file
# should contain only 1 phrase in 1 language and nothing else.
# Verbal annotations, and -meaning files (see samples README
# file for details) can also be in .txt files.

# (Note: If you delete the "This is vocab.txt" message
# on the top line of this file, Gradint's GUI will assume
# you don't need to be asked if you're sure when editing files)

# The three lines below are to help the Emacs editor.
